# Welcome to Wicca's Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `src/stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

<br />

## The format will be

- Components

  - These are little pieces of code, such as buttons, textboxes, and so on
  - These have settings to change the appearance of them.

- Blocks

  - This is the next stage from components
  - We use components to build blocks, an example of a block would be a navigation bar, or a form
  - These are more complex, and may result in accessibility errors, which will be checked automatically

- Final UI
  - This is when all blocks and components are put together, rendering a whole webpage
  - This makes changing components easier for designer and developer, as a minor change in component will only require a small edit

## Some examples of this include

- [Adobe's Design System](https://5f0dd5ad2b5fc10022a2e320-hwhlxszzxc.chromatic.com/)
- [Audi's Design System](https://react.ui.audi/)
- [Composite Components (with accessibility)](https://61a90feace7802003a4d9c45-ehgithjrzj.chromatic.com/?path=/story/composite-components-button--default-button)
